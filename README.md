# Waterfall
Given an array of heights: ``[5, 3, 7, 2, 6, 4, 5, 9, 1, 2]``

Visualized like so:
![empty towers](https://i.imgur.com/xtN9vVV.png){:height="150px" width="150px"}

Imagine that it rains.

![full towers](https://i.imgur.com/jJkBtUY.png){:height="150px" width="150px"}

This service returns the two walls that have the most water between them, with exactly how much water that is.

Output for the above ``[3, 8, 11]``, between tower #3 and tower #8 there are 11 blocks of water.
